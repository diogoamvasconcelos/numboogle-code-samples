##About Numboggle
Numboggle is a simple mobile game, made in Unity 5, by myself based on a existing game, the Boogle, with the help of Luisa Rodrigues (who had the ideia, helped in the specification, tested and gave support).

This project was also inspired by the Assignment 4 of [Standford CS106B - Programming Abstractions](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/cs106b) by Professor Eric Roberts on Winter Term 2015.
